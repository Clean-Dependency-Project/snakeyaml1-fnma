***The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity.***

## Overview ##
[YAML](http://yaml.org) is a data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages.

SnakeYAML is a YAML 1.1 processor for the Java Virtual Machine version 8.
For YAML 1.2 (which is a superset of JSON) you may have a look at [SnakeYAML Engine](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml-engine)

## SnakeYAML features ##

* a **complete** [YAML 1.1 processor](http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/current.html). (If you need YAML **1.2** support have a look [here](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml-engine)). In particular, SnakeYAML can parse all examples from the specification.
* Unicode support including UTF-8/UTF-16 input/output.
* high-level API for serializing and deserializing native Java objects.
* support for all types from the [YAML types repository](http://yaml.org/type/index.html).
* relatively sensible error messages.
* when you plan to feed the parser with untrusted data please study the settings which allow to restrict incoming data.
